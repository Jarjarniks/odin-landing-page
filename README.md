# odin-landing-page
Landing page project, second of TOP's curriculum.

This will be my second try at using git while creating a website. My goal with this project
is to practice making new repositories, cloning it locally, and working with the command terminal to make
frequent commits accompanied by short, concise commit messages explaining changes.

My goal is also to create a good looking, responsive website that matches the design documentation!
